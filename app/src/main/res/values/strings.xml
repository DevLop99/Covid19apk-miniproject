    <string name="advice3para"></string>
    <string name="advice3afterwhy"> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</string>

    <string name="advice4para">Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</string>
    <string name="advice4afterwhy">Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19</string>

Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</string>
